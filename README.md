# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Kaggle-competition-
A Kaggle competition: A classification problem for predicting credit card fraud

Main algorithms: 
  1) SMOTE: in order to remedy severe class imbalances via supersampling of minority class (positive class: 1)
  2) Distributed Random Forest (DRF) to fit the model (from h2o.ai library).
  
Suggestions to go further: 1) feature engineering to find most important features ad train the model based upon. 2) Use another algorithm such as xgboost, gbm, etc.
